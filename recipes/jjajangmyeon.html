        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Stir-fry the pork belly in a large, deep wok (or pan) with 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil for about 4-5 minutes, until golden brown and crispy. </li>
            <li> Pour out the excess pork fat. </li>
            <li> Add radish and stir fry for 1 minute. </li>
            <li> Add potato, onion, and zucchini and keep stirring for about 3 minutes until the potato looks a little translucent.</li>
            <li> Clear a space in the center of the wok by pushing the ingredients to the edges. </li>
            <li> Add 2 Tablespoons of vegetable oil to the center of the wok, then add ¼ cup of black bean paste and stir it with a wooden spoon for 1 minute to fry it. Then mix everything in the wok and keep stirring.</li>
            <li> Add  2 cups of water to the wok and let it simmer and cook with the lid closed for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Open the lid and taste a sample of the radish and potato. If they’re fully cooked, stir in the starch water little by little. Keep stirring until it’s well mixed and thick.</li>
            <li> Add the sesame oil and remove from the heat.</li>
            <li> Boil the noodles in a large pot and drain. Rinse and strain in cold water.</li>
            <li> Put one serving of noodles onto a serving plate and add the jjajang sauce over top. Garnish with cucumber strips and serve immediately with kimchi or yellow pickled radish.</li>
